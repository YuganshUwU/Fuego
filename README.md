# Fuego Programming Language

**Fuego** is an innovative, semicolon-separated programming language designed by me. Built with C++ for coding and Assembly for code generation, it aims to provide a fresh take on programming language syntax.

This project is strongly intended for learning purposes and is a fun side hustle🧑‍💻. It's a way to explore the inner workings of compilers, programming languages, and how various systems interact — all while creating something unique!
